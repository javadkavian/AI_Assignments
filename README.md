## Assignment 1: Genetic Algorithm for Solving Knapsack Problem  
In this assignment, we explore the application of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to solve the classic Knapsack Problem. The objective is to maximize the total value of items placed in a knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity. We implement several GA operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve a population of potential solutions iteratively.  

### Key Techniques  
- Genetic Algorithms  
- Selection, Crossover, and Mutation Operators  
- Fitness Function Evaluation  

## Assignment 2: Hidden Markov Models for Voice Recognition  
This assignment focuses on implementing Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for voice recognition tasks. We utilize a speech dataset to train the model and evaluate its performance in recognizing different spoken phrases. The assignment emphasizes understanding the HMM structure and the forward-backward algorithm for training and inference.  

### Key Techniques  
- Hidden Markov Models  
- Forward-Backward Algorithm  
- Viterbi Algorithm  

## Assignment 3: Clustering the Iris Dataset Using K-Means and DBSCAN  
In this assignment, we apply clustering techniques on the famous Iris dataset. We implement both K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms to group the data points based on their features. The objective is to compare the effectiveness of these clustering methods in uncovering the natural grouping of the Iris species.  

### Key Techniques  
- K-Means Clustering  
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)  
- Silhouette Score Evaluation  

## Assignment 4: Machine Learning Methods - Regression, Boosting, and Decision Trees  
In this assignment, we explore various machine learning methods, with a focus on regression techniques, boosting algorithms, and decision trees. We apply these methods to a real-world dataset and evaluate their performance based on different metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.  

### Key Techniques  
- Linear Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- Boosting

## Assignment 5: Neural Network and Training a CNN Model for Sentiment Classification of Tweets  
This assignment involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for sentiment classification of tweets. We preprocess the Twitter data using the Word2Vec model to create word embeddings and train the CNN on the processed data. The goal is to accurately classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.  

### Key Techniques  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- Word2Vec for Word Embeddings  
- Sentiment Analysis  

## Assignment 6: Reinforcement Learning - Applying Q-Learning Algorithm in a Snake Game  
In the final assignment, we implement the Q-Learning algorithm in a simplified version of the Snake game. The agent learns to navigate the game environment through trial and error, using a reward system to improve its performance over time. The project highlights the key concepts of reinforcement learning and the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.  

### Key Techniques  
- Q-Learning Algorithm  
- Markov Decision Processes (MDP)  
- Reward Mechanism
